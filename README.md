Each subfolder refers to the problem with solutions in different languages. Only accepted solutions should be added.

System design notes - for each meeting please keep all related materials in the corresponding
folder. The structure is of free format, however it would be good to have links
to original paper, ideas, sketches, photos of the whiteboard from the meeting and whatever relevant/useful 
material to help us go back to these material and easily remember what was discussed.
